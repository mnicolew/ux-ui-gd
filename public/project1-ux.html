                    <p>We conducted four interviews with substitutes teachers and faculty members to determine what
                        technological interactions (in current absence management systems) were working, or not working
                        well. Empathizing with our user group helped us identify the needs that were not being met with
                        existing resources. Our user research became the basis of all design decisions and later helped
                        us create our personas and user journey map. </p>
                    <H4>C O M P E T I T I V E &nbsp; A N A L Y S I S</H4>
                    <p>With our competitive analysis, each group member conducted research on different
                        products/services that would potentially share the market with STEM. We focused on identifying
                        how the product meets or fails to meet user’s goals and motivations. In completing this, we were
                        able to use our findings to better understand our user's pain points and goals. </p>
                    <H4>P E R S O N A S</H4>
                    <p>Using our interview takeaways, we built two personas: a substitute (Ava) and a teacher (Malcom).
                        More importantly, we were able to highlight our interviewee’s pain points and their
                        goals/desires. Each persona includes characteristics, pain points, desires, goals and technology
                        proficiency based on all of interviews to make them as realistic as possible.

                    <p>After deciding to choose substitutes as our primary user group, we began modeling our user
                        journey map after Ava Jones' persona. Creating the map helped us empathize and get a better
                        understanding of what kind of emotions are associated with the pain points we identified from
                        interviews and our competitive analysis.

                    <p>In creating storyboards, we were able to brainstorm our stories to put into our potential
                        product. This helped us convey design ideas visually based on user experience and depict
                        different aspects of our design. We chose to brainstorm representative scenarios that substitute
                        teachers would face, such as booking a job and receiving job notifications.</p>
                    <H4>I N F O R M A T I O N &nbsp; A R C H I T E C T U R E</H4>
                    <p>In creating our design requirements and visual storyboards, we organized our information
                        architecture by mapping out the user's flow through the software. This helped us outline how
                        users would interact with our product.</p>

                    <p>We used paper prototypes to quickly visualize our three key tasks. This was an efficient way to
                        test if our designs meet the potential user’s expectations and needs.

                    <p>After creating our paper prototypes, we reached out to individuals who were
                        teachers/substitutes/students in education to receive feedback on our provisional work. Through
                        usability testing we were able to identify our product's shortcomings and iterate on our designs
                        before the wireframes.</p>
                    <H4>W I R E F R A M E S</H4>
                    <p>With our wireframes, we learned to keep it simple and focus on structure rather than
                        functionality. Wireframing gave us an opportunity to be consistent with typography, spacing and
                        edges.</p>

                    <p>We created a high fidelity prototype to convey how the final product would look and operate. We
                        were able to use our wireframes and low-fidelity mock-ups to reach this stage. Using our in
                        class critique, we refined our design and final product to show our key tasks: booking a job,
                        instant messaging and calendar sync feature. </p>

                    <p>In terms of project takeaways, we learned user research plays a key role in design process. We
                        practiced many research methods to stay in contact with user group, whether it’s primary or
                        secondary. Although our user group was not easily reachable, we challenged ourselves to explore
                        user pain points, needs and expectations. We learned to design intentionally--Designers should
                        have reasons for each design decision, whether it’s major or minor. As we continued to progress
                        in our project, we always remembered to reflect from our interviews and remember why we are
                        creating an absence management system for substitutes.

                        Additionally with more time, we all would have liked to focus more on interaction design and
                        conduct more research through interviews or user testing. In doing so, we believe we would have
                        added more features recommended from our user testing to better fit their goals and motivation.
                        In conducting more user testing, we would have had more feedback on a variety of our key
                        components.
                        ​
                        More importantly, our project user group really allowed us to think outside the UW community. It
                        has allowed us to think critically as designers and not be biased or make assumptions based on
                        our own experience in school districts. </p>
                    <H4>T E A M &nbsp; R E F L E C T I O N</H4>
                    <p>In the course of 9 weeks, we learned that communication is key and one of our biggest challenges
                        as a team. From the start of our project, we struggled to find a time to meet and complete group
                        assignments together. As weeks progress, we finally solidified the days we would meet. A typical
                        meeting would last 3 hours the shortest up to 5+ hours. In meeting so often, we realized in
                        order to function as group and have a cohesive goal, it was very important to update each other
                        and hold each other accountable. This meant updating about individual progress or upcoming
                        conflicts.

                        However with the 9 weeks, we weren't able to fully assess our individual strengths and
                        weaknesses. If given more time, we would have gone back as team to strengthen our project with
                        the skills we individually thrived in. With a short time frame, we weren’t able to spend a
                        significant amount of time figuring out the work balance with the skills we all had. We believe
                        if we had more time to sit down and talk about our individual strengths, our project would have
                        flowed more smoothly.
                        ​
                        Overall, each member brought their own set of skills with varying backgrounds. Every decision we
                        made was a collaborative and well thought out one. From late nights in the Sieg lounge to seeing
                        each other at 9 AM for class, we have made many long-lasting memories together.
